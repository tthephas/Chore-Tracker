# Chore-Tracker (Kids piggy bank)

The Kids piggy bank app (or Chore Tracker, or PigMint-play off piggy bank + Mint financial app for adults) brings together two issues that are hard for parents AND kids to track on a daily/weekly basis. The piggy bank of the past is an outdated concept. Kids would push cash and change in a real piggy bank. Every few months they would dump this all out and organize only to count the amount at that moment, then return the money to the piggy bank. After a while they would get a bank account in their parents name. But the accounts for kids under 16 dont allow for easy visibility, deposits, or withdrawals. Many of these tasks are still on the parents to administer.

This app would solve many of those issues. The app would clearly show a child how much is in their bank, digitally. It would be an easy website/app for the kids to log into with very little friction on username/password. They could see current amount and possibly history of how it has grown. They will also see how they can increase the amount, thru chores. They will have a list of chores to choose from, or be able to make their own. Each chore will have an assigned dollar amount. When a child does one of these chores successfully, they will see the money added to their piggy bank. They have the ability to make up their own chores and negotiate the amount with their parents. They also have some way to prove that they did the chore, thru timestamps and/or pictures.

This app provides parents and children an EASY way to see current piggy bank amounts, but to also encourage chores done in the house. This can ultimately help children to build up the account, encourage saving, and give them much needed financial education in their early years.
